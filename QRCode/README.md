# QR code widgets
This directory is for QR code related projects.

## Generating QR codes
The file `index.html` contains JavaScript code which can generate encode plain text into a QR code. [Live demo here](https://spurwing.github.io/Appointment-Scheduling-Widgets/QRCode/)

The default settings allow you to encode 62 characters, which is usally enough for a simple URL or message.
If you need to encode longer texts you can tweek the settings (`version` and `ECL`) using this [reference sheet](https://www.qrcode.com/en/about/version.html).
